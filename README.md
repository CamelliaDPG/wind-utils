# Nalu Wind Energy Utilities

![Docs status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/naluwindutils/badge/)

NaluWindUtils is a companion software library to [Nalu](http://nalu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) --- a generalized, unstructured,
massively parallel, low-Mach flow solver for wind energy applications. As the
name indicates, this software repository provides various meshing, pre- and
post-processing utilities for use with the Nalu CFD code to aid setup and
analysis of wind energy LES problems. This software is licensed under [Apache
